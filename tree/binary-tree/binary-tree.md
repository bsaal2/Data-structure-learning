## Introduction

Binary is a type of tree where node has maximum two childrens

## Travesal

There are different tree traversal techniques.
Following are them

### 1. Depth First Search (DFS)

In this traversal, one branch is traversed all the way to end and then return
Same things happens to all branches of tree

####  a. Pre-order Traversal

#### b. In-order Traversal

#### c. Post-order Traversal
